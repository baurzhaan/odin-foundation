    <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
    <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>

    <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
  </ul>

  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>To make the crêpes: Combine milk, water, eggs, sugar, and salt in a blender; blend on medium speed until smooth,
      about 10 seconds. Add flour and blend until smooth, about 5 more seconds. Add 2 tablespoons of the melted butter
      and orange zest; pulse until incorporated, about 3 (1-second) pulses. Cover blender and place in refrigerator; let
      rest for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove crêpe batter from fridge. Heat a 6-inch nonstick skillet or crêpe pan over medium heat. Add 1/2 teaspoon
      of the melted butter and swirl to coat skillet. Add 2 tablespoons batter and swirl to coat bottom of skillet.
      Cook, undisturbed, until the bottom is lightly golden, and the top is still a little moist, about 1 minute. Swirl
      skillet to loosen crêpe and gently flip with a spatula and your fingers. Cook until golden, about 30 seconds.
      Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining butter and batter.</li>
    <li>To make the orange sauce: Combine orange juice, white sugar, and orange zest in a small skillet over medium
      heat. Cook, stirring often, until sugar is dissolved and the liquid starts to bubble, 3 to 4 minutes. Gradually
      add butter, piece by piece, stirring constantly, until it is melted and fully incorporated. Let sauce come back up
      to a simmer and let simmer until slightly syrupy, stirring occasionally, about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in orange
      liqueur and salt. Remove from the heat.</li>
    <li>Fold each crêpe in half, then half again to make a triangle. Dip the folded crêpes into the hot orange sauce.
      Place on a serving platter. Repeat with remaining crêpes, overlapping each crêpe so they are facing the same
      direction.</li>
    <li>To serve, pour orange liqueur into the skillet with the remaining orange sauce and place over medium-high. If it
      does not ignite automatically, use a long-stemmed lighter and carefully set the liqueur on fire. Let it burn for
      about 30 seconds. Pour the flaming liqueur over the crêpes on the platter and serve immediately with ice cream.
